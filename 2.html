           .  A network is a collection of interconnected devices—such<br>
         as computers, servers, routers,<br>
          or other hardware—that communicate with<br> 
          each other to share resources and exchange information.<br>
           These devices are linked through various communication <br>
            channels, which can include cables, telephone lines,<br>
             radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams. <br>
             There are several types of networks,<br>
              each serving different purposes based on their size and scope:<br>

           <samp>. Personal Area Network (PAN)</samp><br>: A small network typically within<br>
            a range of a few meters, connecting devices<br>
         like smartphones, tablets, and laptops, often using technologies like Bluetooth or infrared.<br>
            
            <samp>. Local Area Network (LAN)</samp><br>: A network that connects computers and devices within<br>
             a limited <br>geographical area, such as a home, school,<br>
             or office building. LANs often use wired connections like<br>
             
            Ethernet or wireless technologies like Wi-Fi.<br>
            
            <samp>. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</samp><br>: A larger network that spans a city or<br>
             a large campus, connecting multiple LANs to facilitate<br>
             high-speed data transfer across a broader area.<br>
            
           <samp>. Wide Area Network (WAN)</samp><br>: A network that covers a large geographic area, <br>such as a country or continent, connecting multiple LANs and MANs.<br>The internet is the largest example of a WAN.<br>
            
            
            Networks rely on communication protocols—rules that define
             how data is transmitted and received—to ensure <br>
             reliable and secure data exchange. For example,<br> 
             the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet<br>
             Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is fundamental to <br>internet<br>
             communications,<br> managing how data packets are addressed,<br>
             transmitted, and routed across networks. <br>
            
            Effective network design considers factors like topology<br>
             (the arrangement of network devices and connections), <br>
             security measures to protect data and resources, and <br>
             scalability to accommodate future growth. Understanding <br>
             these aspects is crucial for building efficient and secure<br>
              networks that meet the needs of users and organizations. <br>
